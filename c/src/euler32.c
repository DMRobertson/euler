/*
We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

/* If a k-digit number is a product of an n-digit and m-digit number, then n+m-1 <= k <= n+m.
We have the constraint n+m+k = 9.
If n+m=k then n + m + k = 2k = 9, which has no integer solution.
So n+m-1=k; then n + m + k = 2k + 1 = 9, which means that k = 4 and n+m = 5.
We only need to look at 4-digit numbers 1000...9999 (of which there are 9000) and try to factorise them as 1 digit * 4-digit or 2-digit * 3-digit.
